# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
### Project Details
- The internet and technological advancements are having a great impact on restaurant operations. With most people spending a big part of their day on the internet, it provides a huge market potential for restaurants. In fact, the demand for online food ordering continues to grow among the consumers. To guarantee full consumer satisfaction and to ensure company gain profits, they should make sure that the food orders are delivered on time. The company is consistently looking for solutions that makes food delivered on time without any delays.

### Opportunity
- Almost every customer who order food online, expects the food is delivered as fast as possible without any delays. As the market of food delivery services has increased these days, in order to compete the rivals and provide at most good service, the company wants to deliver food order as early as possible to the consumer.

### Approach
- The idea behind this project is to analyze how the company is performing in terms of delivering orders. Whether the orders are delivered on time or late. If there is any late delivery the company can recommend follow-up actions. We analyzed around 11 thousand food orders to understand the attributes that can explain the delivery time. Three models were used for the prediction of which one with best accuracy was selected.

### Results
- I have used the r2 score as our measurement metric and achieved an accuracy of 90%+ on the test as well as validation data.
